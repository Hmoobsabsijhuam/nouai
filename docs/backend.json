We achieve this by separating user data and admin role definitions into distinct collections.  The structure prioritizes simplicity and leverages path-based ownership for user data.  Admin roles are determined by the *existence* of a document in a dedicated `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection, enabling simple presence checks in security rules without relying on complex data comparisons. This is more robust than storing the admin role within the user document itself. The path-based ownership structure `/users/{userId}` ensures secure `list` operations, as rules can easily restrict access based on the authenticated user ID."

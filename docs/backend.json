    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage user authentication and admin roles, ensuring authorization independence and supporting secure list operations (QAPs). We achieve this by separating user data and admin role definitions into distinct collections. The structure prioritizes simplicity and leverages path-based ownership for user data. Admin roles are determined by the *existence* of a document in a dedicated `/roles_admin/{uid}` collection, enabling simple presence checks in security rules without relying on complex data comparisons. This is more robust than storing the admin role within the user document itself. The path-based ownership structure `/users/{userId}` ensures secure `list` operations, as rules can easily restrict access based on the authenticated user ID. A global `notifications` collection is added for admins to broadcast messages to all users, with rules allowing all signed-in users to read and admins to write."
